                    I'd prefer as little formal definition as possible and simple mathematics.

                        <p>Quick note, this is almost certainly confusing Big O notation (which is an upper bound) with Theta notation (which is a two-side bound). In my experience this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings. Apologies for any confusion caused. <br>There are some important and deliberately chosen words in that sentence:</p>

                            Big-O notation (also called "asymptotic growth" notation) is what functions "look like" when you ignore constant factors and stuff near the origin. We use it to talk about how thing scale.

                            Basics

                            for "sufficiently" large inputs...

                            f(x) ∈ O(upperbound) means f "grows no faster than" upperbound
                            f(x) ∈ Ɵ(justlikethis) mean f "grows exactly like" justlikethis
                            f(x) ∈ Ω(lowerbound) means f "grows no slower than" lowerbound
                            big-O notation doesn't care about constant factors: the function 9x² is said to "grow exactly like" 10x². Neither does big-O asymptotic notation care about non-asymptotic stuff ("stuff near the origin" or "what happens when the problem size is small"): the function 10x² is said to "grow exactly like" 10x² - x + 2.</p>

                            <p>As a purely mathematical construct, big-O notation is not limited to talking about processing time and memory. You can use it to discuss the asymptotics of anything where scaling is meaningful, such as:

                            the number of possibly handshakes among N people at a party (Ɵ(N²), specifically N(N-1)/2, but what matters is that it "scales like" N²)</p>

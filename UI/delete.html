                    Tail recursion is a perfectly efficient technique in a programming language optimized for it. For the right sort of problem, it may be considerably more expressive an an iterative implementation. The answer probably means "in Python specifically" but that isn't what it says – Peter R

                    A method of solving these is called an algorithm. Addition is the simplest. You line the numbers up (to the right) and add the digits in a column writing the last number of that addition … towns there isn't enough time left in the universe to solve the problem with traditional computers. Something to think about. Polynomial Time Another point I wanted to make quick mention of is that any
